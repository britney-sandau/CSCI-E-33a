Dear Teaching Fellow,

Below are the following sources I used to solve the project 1 requirements. I also found the notes and section lectures helpful as well as the documentation for Django and markdown. I apologize for the delay, I had a family emergency and I had been struggling on how to solve some of the functions. I found it got easier once I drew up my code in pseudocode. Then it was like trying to plug in the pieces. There are still some things missing and I did not have time to style it like I wanted to using bootstrap. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Best regards,
Britney Sandau
